## KaraokeRemote
KaraokeRemote is an Android app used to control a karaoke player through the 
Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) protocol. The device information and service 
descriptions for the UPnP device can be found at 
[root-device.xml](./UPnP_Device_and_Service_Descriptions/root-device.xml) and
[karaoke-manager-scpd.xml](./UPnP_Device_and_Service_Descriptions/karaoke-manager-scpd.xml).
KaraokeRemote should be considered to be in the pre-alpha stage with only 
minimal testing completed. This project has been released under the MIT license in the 
hopes that someone may find it useful for their own project.
